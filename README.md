## Java ScriptEngine example
There are interpreters for various script languages for use with the JVM. Here is a simple example as a JUnit test.

*Most interpreters are not up to date with the latest programming language, but they can still be useful if you want 
to make an application extensible.*

**used engines:**
* nashorn engine of the jdk for JavaScript
* jruby(http://jruby.org/) for Ruby
* jython(http://www.jython.org/) for Python
* Renjin(http://www.renjin.org/) for 'R'
